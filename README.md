# prod-2
SPA's mostly. My first repo for development was main-dev, but now that one is getting a lot of things in it, and I wan't to make the most any dev repo have 15 applications in it. Whenever I make a new one, it will go here until it also has 15 applications. Changed this from main-dev to prod for clarity reasons. Not renaming the first one as it has dependencies.

Note: just because something is in prod does not mean it is working necessarily, it just means that I am out of the initial attempts to get it running at all whatsoever. If its not working the way I want, it may still end up abandoned here.
